# ApamaSenseHat

This repo will host examples that show how to use a RaspberryPi SenseHAT from EPL in [Apama Core Community Edition](http://apamacommunity.com).
This functionality requires Apama 10.3 or later as it depends on the feature to call out to Python plugins from EPL.

Examples in subfolders include:
* **HelloWorld** - scroll a message across the LED matrix on the SenseHAT
